# System Design Hub
## About the System Design Hub
This hub is an archive of work done by the System Design team at the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government (MHCLG). The team includes designers, researchers and analysts. We bring user-centred design and systems thinking skills to complex building safety challenges. Our work involves doing projects with policy teams and strategic systems thinking.\ 
We publish reports and outputs from our work so that others can learn about the building safety and quality system, our research participants can see the impact of our work, and similar teams can learn from our approaches.\
No single person, team or report can cover every aspect of the system, so our work offers snapshots in time. Our reports do not represent official government policy but instead document what we've heard from the at the heart of the building safety and quality system.

### Housing Safety and Quality System Mapping
We were asked to mapp the system of people and things that relate to the safety, quality and sustainability of residential buildings, with the aims to:\
* Visualise a clear view of the as-is system ​\
* Deliver insights about the reality of that landscape \
* Identify gaps, challenges and opportunities for further change​\
We did this through developing an understanding of the people in the system, their roles and responsibilities, and what policies say should be happening through desk resesearch. When we say people in the system that includes everyone from regulators, to people working in construction, those providing insurance and finance, and of course residents. Then we did primary research with people working in the system to understand their behaviours, relationships and experiences. We used our research to map how different parts of the system interact, understand what's actually happening, and identify levers for change. We turned our research into tools and reports to support our policy colleagues to make decisions and develop policies for the future. \
