# System Design Hub
## About the System Design Hub
This hub is an archive of work done by the System Design team at the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government (MHCLG). The team includes designers, researchers and analysts. We bring user-centred design and systems thinking skills to complex building safety challenges. Our work involves doing projects with policy teams and strategic systems thinking. 
We publish reports and outputs from our work so that others can learn about the building safety and quality system, our research participants can see the impact of our work, and similar teams can learn from our approaches.
No single person, team or report can cover every aspect of the system, so our work offers snapshots in time. Our reports do not represent official government policy but instead document what we've heard from the at the heart of the building safety and quality system.
