# System Design Hub
## About the System Design Hub
This hub is an archive of work done by the System Design team at the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government (MHCLG). The team includes designers, researchers and analysts. We bring user-centred design and systems thinking skills to complex building safety challenges. Our work involves doing projects with policy teams and strategic systems thinking.

We publish reports and outputs from our work so that others can learn about the building safety and quality system, our research participants can see the impact of our work, and similar teams can learn from our approaches.

No single person, team or report can cover every aspect of the system, so our work offers snapshots in time or deep dives on specific areas rather a representative view of the whole system. Our reports are often marked as Official like the majority of information that is created,processed, sent or received in the public sector and by partner organisations. But the insights it contains reflect what we've heard from people at the heart of the system, rather than MHCLG policy positions.

### Housing Safety and Quality System Mapping
We mapped the system of people and things that relate to the safety, quality and sustainability of residential buildings, with the aims of:
* Visualising a clear view of the as-is system ​
* Delivering insights about the reality of that landscape 
* Identifying gaps, challenges and opportunities for further change​

| [Map of who regulates the system](https://github.com/communitiesuk/system-design-hub/blob/main/reports/MHCLG%20System%20Design%20Regulatory%20Actors%20Map.pdf)  | Shows the different regulators (government, private sector, redress, associations and advisory bodies) involved in maintaining building safety and quality from planning through to occupation and remediation.  |
| [Map of how the system is regulated](https://github.com/communitiesuk/system-design-hub/blob/main/reports/MHCLG%20System%20Design%20How%20Housing%20Safety%20and%20Quality%20are%20Regulated%20Map.pdf)  | Shows some of the regulated activities within the system through the lifecycle of a building.|
| [Map of housing landscape](https://github.com/communitiesuk/system-design-hub/blob/main/reports/MHCLG%20System%20Design%20Housing%20Landscape%20Maps.pdf)  | Shows the different buildings people live in and their scale across England. |
| [Map of roles involved in multi-occupancy buildings](https://github.com/communitiesuk/system-design-hub/blob/main/reports/MHCLG%20System%20Design%20Roles%20in%20Multi-Occupancy%20Buildings.pdf) | Shows the different people who live in and manage some multi-occupancy buildings e.g. blocks of flats, and their scale in England.  |
| [Map of factors influencing the maintenance of homes](https://github.com/communitiesuk/system-design-hub/blob/main/reports/MHCLG%20System%20Design%20Maintaining%20Housing%20Safety%20and%20Quality%20Maps.pdf)  | Shows the factors that influence whether a building’s safety, quality and sustainability are maintained including variations highlighting different home ownership and tenancy structures, and the impact this has on the roles, responsibilities and difficulties in maintaining residential properties.  |

### Resident experiences of housing safety and quality 
We built an evidence base and tools for policy teams around resident experiences, needs and mental models around building safety, quality and its regulation. 
We looked to understand: 
* Current resident experiences of safety, quality and regulation of homes, particularly around resolving issues 
* Residents levels of trust, confidence and consumer power in the built environment, to consider how the regulatory environment might need to change to support better outcomes for residents
These outputs have been used to support and inform policymaking on the future of regulation.

This report covers the regulatory context, residents’ understanding of safety and quality, resident experiences of raising issues, findings on trust, consumer power and confidence and resident relationship models. |
